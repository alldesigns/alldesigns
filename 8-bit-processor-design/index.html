As this is a simple processor we are going to implement the. Be carried out with the help of separate data and instruction And in the similar way operations like subtraction AND OR memory ie. My original processor was designed to be very simple to give me a good chance of making a working processor but it had some serious flaws. To design this simple processor we need a simple instruction set architecture.

<p>An Alpha 64 Out Of Order Processor Design Shibo Chen In 2021 Computer Engineering Phd Student Design The processor can execute with simplified design for more number of instructions and obtained less critical path delay. We have to convert assembly code into machine code. This means designing my own assembly language and its machine language. 5 Memory From outside memory is 256 words of 8-bits each zSeparate writedata and memdata ports Internally 64 words of 32-bits each zUpper 6 bits of adr used to select which word zLower 2 bits of adr used to select which byte At initialization loaded from a file named memfiledat zWhose format is as a csv like file zWhere each line in file is.</p>
