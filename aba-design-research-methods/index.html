<p>Research Methods in Applied Behavior Analysis - 1. ABA designs also known as reversal designs are among a family of single-case experimental designs most often used by behavioral scientists and educators to evaluate the effectiveness of clinical or educational interventions. Also called the ABA design. These methods form the heart of the data collection and analytic code of behavior analysis.</p>

ABA designs also known as reversal designs are among a family of single-case experimental designs most often used by behavioral scientists and educators to evaluate the effectiveness of clinical or educational interventions. Design plan and conduct research such that experimentation conditions are as different as possible -Control extraneous systematic variance Minimize other factors that may influence the dependent variable. Research methods in applied behavior analysis introduces the reader to behaviour analysis and its purpose. This rewarding career path is a great way to make a steady income while helping children become valuable members of society. ABA therapy utilizes behavioral principles to set goals reinforce behaviors and measure outcomes.</p>
