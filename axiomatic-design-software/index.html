<p>Axiom Web Design Design Gaming Setup We have developed a generic approach to software design. Axiomatics design team works closely with our customers to understand application requirements and to look for innovative and effective solutions. Design problems are formulated and design solutions developed from abstract to detailed down hierarchies of abstraction and across functional physical and process domains during a zigzagging decomposition process so that the design solution is consistent with the axioms. In the past these design axioms were applied primarily to the design of hardware manufacruring processes and organizations although the applicability of the design axioms to software design was always.</p>
