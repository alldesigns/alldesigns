<p>Hvac Fundamentals Training Course Hvac Basics Pdf Hvac Hvac System Design Hvac Design The air duct distribution network is an important component of HVAC. Furnaces and air conditioners require a certain amount of airflow measured in CFM Cubic Feet Per Minute to be passed through the equipment supply and return ducts in order for the equipment to function properly and efficiently. Thus it is necessary to design the air duct system in such a way that the capital cost of ducts and the cost of running the fans is lower. Duct leakage Figure 1 can occur on either the supply side or the return side of the air handler as well as in the air handler itself.</p>

<p>Air Ducts Friction Loss Diagram Diagram Duct Work Friction Thus it is necessary to design the air duct system in such a way that the capital cost of ducts and the cost of running the fans is lower. Low-velocity ductwork design is very important for energy efficiency in air distribution systems. Thus it is necessary to design the air duct system in such a way that the capital cost of ducts and the cost of running the fans is lower. In main duct Size air duct so that static pressure nearly offset the pressure loss of succeeding duct section along main duct.</p>
