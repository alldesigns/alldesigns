<p>Pin On Diy Season 14 has record ratings because of the win of a plus-size designer. Ayana is a practicing Muslim woman and per an interview with Marie Claire the designer said that she started to get sick of wearing the same kind of bulky modest clothing all the time growing. It really was the craziest most surreal experience said Ayana Ife the hijabi designer in the show. Since winning Project Runway season 6 the first season on Lifetime Shabayeva has built a custom bridal and eveningwear business.</p>
