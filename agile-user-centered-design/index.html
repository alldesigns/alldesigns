<p>Ux User Centered Design Process Spectrum Methods Methodology Scrum Process Agile Development Agile Development Scrum User Centered Design Interaction design shares many of the characteristics of Agile Table 1 however they are rarely combined and there can be conflict between the two practices eg.
