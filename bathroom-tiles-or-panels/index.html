<p>Alternative To Bathroom Wall Tiles Bathroom Shower Panels Shower Wall Panels Bathroom Wall Panels Shower walls definitely have an advantage over tiles in that they consist of fewer parts. I sent a photo to the manufacturers and asked if the plumber had used the right strip and if it was actually meant to look like that and they said yes. We have raw wooden furniture in the bathroom with a Belfast sink and water spout taps so we opted for the shaker finish to compliment the floor tiles. Ceiling height is an issue.</p>
