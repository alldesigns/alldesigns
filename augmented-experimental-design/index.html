Since interest lies in estimating the block effects and consequently the new variety effects from that portion of the experiment on the check varieties it would be desirable to select augmented block designs which are connected and which satisfy. An augmented design is any standard design in control treatments augmented with additional new or test treatments in complete or incomplete blocks in one-way heterogeneity setting. This design is commonly used to evaluate a large number of germplasm lines where seed is in small quantity and other designs are not appropriate due to large number of entries.</p>
