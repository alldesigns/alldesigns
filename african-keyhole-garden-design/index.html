<p>How To Make A Keyhole Garden An African Style Raised Garden Bed Keyhole Garden Raised Garden Herb Garden Design I love the stacked functions in this design. Maintenance of the keyhole garden useful tips for beginners. The African keyhole garden is different from the Mandala design since the center of the raised bed is dedicated to nutrients and the access to the plants is done from the outside.
