<p><strong>Automobile Differential Design</strong>, This is why we need differential to drive both the wheels at different speeds. This differential makes use of in vex satellite and side gears which mechanically resist differentiation once engaged. It only comes into play when one wheel needs to rotate differentially with respect to its counterpart.</p>

<p>Design Optimization of Differential Bevel Gear for NVH Improvement. In vehicles without a differential such as karts both driving wheels are forced to rotate at the same speed usually on a common axle driven by a simple chain-drive mechanism.

<p>The Buggy Reboot By Joey Ruiter Buggy Car Design Concept Car Design Design calculations are done on the differential of Ashokleyland 2516M by varying materials and speeds. Differential gear is modeled in Solid works. The differential is a device that splits the engine torque two ways allowing each output to spin at a different speed. The differential is found on all modern cars and trucks and also in many all-wheel-drive full-time four-wheel-drive vehicles.</p>

<p>Centre Portion Automotive Mechanic Automobile Engineering Car Mechanic A differential is a gear train with three shafts that has the property that the rotational speed of one shaft is the average of the speeds of the others or a fixed multiple of that average. When the car is moving in a straight line the differential gears do not rotate with respect to their axes. If the inside tire rotates 15 RPM less in a turn than going straight then the outside tire will rotate 15 RPM more than going straight. Design calculations are done on the differential of Ashokleyland 2516M by varying materials and speeds.</p>
