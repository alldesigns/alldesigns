<p>Uba Tuba Granite Kitchen Countertops With White Cabinets Green Granite Kitchen Granite Countertops Kitchen Kitchen Design Countertops Try a bright mosaic tile or a mixture of large plain tiles with a mosaic middle strip. I am concerned about white- can you recommend. As a sample of contrast color selection this kitchen is a good example with cabinets all the way to the ceiling which has Uba Tuba granite tops. For a more modern or country style then go with white cabinets and a white tile and white wall paint.</p>
