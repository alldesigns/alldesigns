<p><strong>Application Of Asic Design</strong>, Application-specific standard product chips are intermediate between ASICs and industry standard integrated circuits like the 7400 series or the 4000. Generally an ASIC design will be undertaken for a product that will have a large production run and the ASIC may contain a very large part of the electronics needed on a single integrated circuit. ASIC design engineers are IT professionals specialized in application-specific integrated circuits used for specific purposes.</p>
