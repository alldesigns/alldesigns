<p>This guide is intended for use by infrastructure specialists or system architects. Active design involves urban planners architects transportation engineers public health professionals community. To put this into context if a passive design provides ventilation and heating using natural non powered systems a building using active design will achieve the same end but have to use technologies such as solar panels heat recovery systems or the use of renewable energy sources such as wind turbines. Active design evidence-based design development and operational strategies to support healthy communities.</p>
