The process of hospital planning onerous enough as it is is further burdened by multi-layered management systems and convoluted hybrid procurement systems concentrated entirely on process rather than on the eventual product. We gave our architects BDP a detailed brief defining the key characteristics we wanted to incorporate. Healing offers a different modality through which to evaluate design choices and expands the spectrum of available options for those choices. Yet the power of the architecture itself to impact a patients recovery time and the overall effectiveness of a facility tends to be overlookedThe new term healing architecture indicates that the built environment has the ability to impact.
