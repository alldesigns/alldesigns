<p>Why Did Apple Drop Support For The Magic Mouse 2 On The Ipad Of course its not like I could actually use the Magic Mouse 2 with a wired connection anyway thanks to this infamous design flaw. As posted in a tweet by Internal Archives an iPhone 11 Pro with a flawed placement of the Apple logo at the back sold for 2700 roughly 201 Lacs. Thank you for showing me what I expected was a design flaw and should be covered by Apple. If it was a design flaw all or most would be failing.</p>

<p>Are Apple Capable Of Designing A Usable Mouse By Chris Kernaghan Ux Collective Unfortunately the Cupertino Californiabased tech company overlooked a very simple design flaw after releasing their wireless multi-touch mouse. After taking years of criticism for their continuation of the one-button mouse Apple effectively flipped the design of a normal mouse upside-down with the sleekly featureless appearance that resulted inspiring its jocular appellation as the first zero-button mouse. At the back of this iPhone the company logo was off-center. One reason for the instability was the aluminium alloy of the case.</p>
