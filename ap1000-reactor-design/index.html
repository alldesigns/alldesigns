Electric the AP1000 is ideal for new base load generation. The AP1000 reactor vessel design pressure and temperature is 2500 psia 171 MPa and 650F 343oC. Jaczko said that computations submitted by Westinghouse the manufacturer of the new AP1000 reactor about the buildings design appeared to be wrong and had led to.</p>
