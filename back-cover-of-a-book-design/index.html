<p><strong>Back Cover Of A Book Design</strong>, The cover of a book comprises not just the front cover but is a set of elements that also includes the back cover and the spine edge and less frequently an inside cover and an inside back cover where the print is doublesided. A book cover uses design elements like color font images or illustrations to reflect key themes that are relevant to the text and helps readers to understand a little more of what its about. As already noted writing a back book blurb is a marketing exercise.</p>
