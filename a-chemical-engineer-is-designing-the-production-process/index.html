<p>These include petroleum refining chemical production alternative fuels food grade products nuclear. The main role of chemical engineers is to design and troubleshoot processes for the production of chemicals fuels foods pharmaceuticals and biologicals to name just a few. It involves the simulation of ammonia production.

Use the free content to start your journey as a chemical process engineer and if you need a closer support take a look in one of my training program. Any chemical engineer can design some large-scale process converting raw materials chemicals living cells energy and microorganisms into some useful products and forms being involved in many aspects of plant operations and design including safety and hazard assessments process analysis and design chemical reaction engineering control. Costellos other expertise include trouble-shooting and optimization feasibility studies computer simulations detail design construction management and startup for your chemical plant. They are most often employed by large-scale manufacturing plants to maximize productivity and product. Process engineers on the other hand often use chemistry principles to design new processes or production methods for goods and materials.</p>
