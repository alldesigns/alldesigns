<h3 id="from-aerospace-to-outer-space-to-cyber-space-you-can-solve-the-worlds-most-complex-challenges-for-our-customers">From aerospace to outer space to cyber space you can solve the worlds most complex challenges for our customers.</h3><p>Job Description Summary This is design engineer role for GE9X Hot Section consists of CDN HPT module within BEC 9X engineering. The onset of WWII meant that some safe and conservative design decisions were made to facilitate monoplane wings and the Warren Girder principle was directly copied to the internal framework of monoplane wings Figure 5. Aircraft engineers design and test aircrafts and aerospace-related equipment. At Lockheed Martin we apply our passion for purposeful innovation to keep people safe and solve the worlds most complex challenges. The aircraft design process is a loosely defined method used to balance many competing and demanding requirements to produce an aircraft that is strong lightweight economical and can carry an adequate payload while being sufficiently reliable to safely fly for the design life of the aircraft. Aeronautical engineers were initially unsure how to combine the new metal construction with a traditional fabric covering 3 used on earlier aircraft.</p>
