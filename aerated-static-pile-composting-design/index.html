<p>The static compost pile can be constructed according to the permeability of the raw materials the weather conditions and the performance of the equipment used. There are no aerated static pile composting systems and only a few recently established contained systems. Air Distribution for ECS Aerated Static Pile Systems ASP The aeration system distributes air through the biomass to enhance composting conditions. Temperature probes were randomly introduced into a freshly built aerated static pile.</p>

The pile length is divided into a series of independent aeration zones and is determined by the size of the compost facility. Static pile composting is a number of systems to biodegrade organic material without physical manipulation during primary composting. This simply means that we induce airflow through the mix of materials using an electric blower - we do not turn the pile during the active phase first 30 days of composting. Aerated Static pile - usually placed on perforated piping providing air circulation for controlled aeration. Fermenting Tank for Compost Production.</p>
