<p>A look inside Hong Kong designer André Fus plush 36th floor model residence reveals that the diagrid also imposes heavily on the building interiors. Designer and architect André Fu made a name for himself a decade ago with the career-making Upper House in his native Hong Kong. With its head office in Hong Kong the studio lists clients such as Maybourne Hotel Group Four Seasons Hotels Resorts Shangri-la Hotels Swire Hotels Capella Hotels Park Hyatt Hotels restauranteur Alan Yau lifestyle retailer Louis Vuitton Lane Crawford and gallerist Emmanuel Perrotin. Hong Kong-based Andre Fu is co-founder of the famed architecture firm André Fu Studio and created the interior design vision and execution for Cassia Capella Singapores Chinese fine-dining restaurant.</p>

Thick beams cut across the apartments floor-to-ceiling windows creating angular views of the cityscape. It was the unrelenting views and the unbelievable volume at his disposal that led Fu to reform the entire space. André Fu founder and principal of André Fu Studio lets his design approach rather than a particular aesthetic drive the vision for his projectsFu who established his studio in 2000 shortly after graduating from Cambridge University with a Master of Architecture degree cites only the fact that all of his designs exhibit a certain kind of Asian sensitivity as a common thread. His recent work on JIA Groups Louise which he fondly refers to as a memorable project is a case in point. The design concept and process are rooted in the dual tenets of Lifestyle and Landscape which provide context meaning and depth to the overall scheme.</p>
