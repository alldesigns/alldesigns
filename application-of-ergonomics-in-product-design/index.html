<p>Thats why Eames chair looks way different from Salvador dalis chair. Ergonomics is a science focused on the study of human ﬁ t and decreased fatigue and discomfort through product design. Ergonomics is central to the effective design and application of a wide range of products for example medical devices that aid hearing or mobility office equipment that minimizes repetitive strain or kitchen utensils that provide safety and comfort in extended use. The design process that involves the application of human factors and ergonomics HFE principles and knowledge strives to achieve the above goals and at the same time reduce the risk of product malfunction or failure reduce the potential for accidents and contribute to overall product acceptance and utility all while reducing the total product life cycle cost.</p>
