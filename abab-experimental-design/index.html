<p>Sage Reference The Sage Encyclopedia Of Abnormal And Clinical Psychology ABAB Design An ABAB design is similar to an ABA design except after the post-treatment measurement period the intervention is re-introduced B with the assumption that the treatment effect will return. It is widely used and has been shown to be effective for improving specific skills and decreasing problem behaviors. ABA therapy utilizes behavioral principles to set goals reinforce behaviors and measure outcomes. This approach is often described as the gold standard in the treatment of autism.</p>

<p>Single Subject Research Designs Research Methods In Psychology 2nd Canadian Edition Single-subject research is a group of research methods that are used extensively in the experimental analysis of behavior and applied behavior analysis with both human and non-human participants. Reversal designs are particularly useful for the evaluation of medication effects because they provide additional information about the effectiveness of treatment. In an ABAB Reversal design an experimenter rotates two or more conditions and has a participant complete several consecutive sessions in each condition. PC ABAB Reversal Graph.</p>
