<p>We are a manufacturing and development company whose main products are innovative axial flux e-motors. After both motors were completely designed they were simulated three dimensionally through the FEM and the. With an axial-flux design theres a larger radius than in a conventional radial motor you get more torque for the same force. New generation non-fossil fuels could work best with an all-new engine design&ndash;with the radial power plant making a comeback.</p>
<h3 id="high-power-density">High power density.</h3><p>We are a manufacturing and development company whose main products are innovative axial flux e-motors. His brushed DC motor design held the magnets stationary with a spinning armature activated by sliding brushes as the rotor. According to Nevada-based Axial Vector Energy Corporation AVEC it has powerful lightweight and highly efficient radial-design engines capable of producing significantly higher horsepower and torque with considerably lower fuel requirements than is the case. The axial design offers complete primary balance and negligible secondary vibration. Axial-flux motor designs also impact electromagnetics characteristics because magnetic flux travels shorter distances. The axial engine architecture allows us to implement our constant volume combustion cycle delivers extremely low vibration in a convenient quasi-cylindrical package and we have overcome the traditional limitations associated with the configuration.</p>
