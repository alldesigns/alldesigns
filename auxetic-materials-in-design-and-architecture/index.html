<p>Kinetix Designing Auxetic Inspired Deformable Material Structures Youtube Interactive Design Membrane Structure Design Our contribution is to derive new principles for auxetic design from the geometric theory of auxetic deformations recently introduced in 6. A large number of auxetic structures have been developed such as foams fibers or composite materials and many other examples can be found in nature as well Liu 2010.
