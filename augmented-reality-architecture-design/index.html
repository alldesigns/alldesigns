Commonly known as AR augmented reality refers to technology that duplicate real-world environments while augmenting rather than replacing a users view of their physical surroundings with. Designer and programmer Cyril Diagne has created an augmented reality tool that can capture images of real-world objects and add them to a computer program in a few seconds. So does every location every phase and every company. Augmented reality AR market reached the 107 billion mark in 2019 and is expected to grow up to 727 billion by 2024 exhibiting a CAGR of 466. Interior design is one of the most popular applications of the AR technology due to providing cost savings and reducing time in interior design creation.</p>
