<p>Pin By Shreen Elkafoury On Swimming Pool Construction Swimming Pool Construction Pool Construction Swimming Pool Kits At this time of year and at night when I am not circulating the water in the above ground pipes drops to 73F22C. Two inches of foam would be effective but it would need to be custom fit to make sure the liner fits properly. Thermo-Wall insulation helps retain heat that is typically lost through the walls of your above ground pool especially during cold nights. Use 8 x 4 x 1 thick Polystyrene sheets in metal skin above ground pools and 8 x 4 x 2 Polystyrene sheets in Timber above ground pools.</p>
