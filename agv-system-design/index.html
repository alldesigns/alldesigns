<p>Although they appear similar the AGV and ASRS serve two separate purposes. Amerden AGVS has a proven approach to the design and delivery of an AGV system. System Logistics manufactures different AGV Outrigger versions that differ in capacity and height. In order to improve the AGVs system efficiency and reliability both Siemens PLC and RFID technologies are applied for the design.</p>
