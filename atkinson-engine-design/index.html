<p><strong>Atkinson Engine Design</strong>, Design The original Atkinson-cycle engine allows the intake compression power and exhaust strokes of the four-stroke cycle to occur in a single turn of the crankshaft and was designed to bypass patents covering the existing Otto cycle engines. The final engine produced by the British Gas Engine company was the Utilite Engine. One is an electric motor and the other power source is a 25L Atkinson-Cycle I4 Hybrid engine.</p>

<p>The final engine produced by the British Gas Engine company was the Utilite Engine. The Atkinson cycle engine design _____ asked Feb 7 2017 in Trades Technology by jullia. The Atkinson cycle has a larger expansion ratio than compression ratio. The engine was designed by James Atkinson in 1882 and like many of the internal combustion engines operating in a four stroke cycle it allows intake compression power and exhaust strokes.</p>
<h3 id="the-video-on-the-blog-post-should-explain-this-in-more-detail">The video on the blog post should explain this in more detail.</h3><p>The clever arrangement of levers allows the Atkinson engine to cycle the piston through all four strokes in only one revolution of the main crankshaft and allows the strokes to be different lengths. Its a clever solution where instead of the modern Atkinson style you have a traditional style Atkinson engine with a modern twist of allowing for variable compression ratio as well. Though Toyota has previously used Atkinson cycle engines in its hybrids its the first time that the Atkinson design will be used as a stand-alone unit and Atkinson Cycle engines arent known. Atkinsons design is that the engines have an expansion stroke that is longer than the compression stroke and by this method the engine achieves greater thermal efficiency than a traditional piston engine. Im now using 0003 and the compression so far just keeps improving as I run the engine. An Atkinson cycle engine makes less power than the otherwise equivalent Otto cycle unit which is why the design is more popular with hybrid models.</p>

Over the years opposed-piston engines have been used tanks trucks locomotives and airplanes. The clever arrangement of levers allows the Atkinson engine to cycle the piston through all four strokes in only one revolution of the main crankshaft and allows the strokes to be different lengths. The Otto-Atkinson cycle engine operates on the Otto cycle at full load for good power density and on the Atkinson cycle at part loads for reduced fuel consumption.</p>

The 2015 Chevy Cruise also has a 18 liter engine though with an Otto cycle and it produces 138 horsepower 7667 horsepowerliter. The video on the blog post should explain this in more detail.</p>

Various examples started appearing toward the end of the 19th century and notably James Atkinson used an opposed-piston design for his first Atkinson Cycle engine. Atkinson produced three different designs that had a short compression stroke and a longer expansion stroke. The Atkinson cycle has a larger expansion ratio than compression ratio.</p>
