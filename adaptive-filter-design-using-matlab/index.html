Add a Sum block to your model to subtract the output of the adaptive filter. 282 SUBBAND ADAPTIVE FILTERING B2 Filtering and adaptive ﬁltering in MATLAB An adaptive ﬁlter as shown in Figure 12 is a time-varying system that uses a recursive adaptive algorithm to continuously adjust its tap weights for operation in an unknown environment. The RLS adaptive filter uses the reference signal on the Input port and the desired signal on the Desired port to automatically match the filter response in the Noise Filter block. An adaptive FIR filter is a FIR filter that uses some kind of an adaptive algorithm to change the filter weights and reach a desired state.
