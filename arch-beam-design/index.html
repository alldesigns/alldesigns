<p><strong>Arch Beam Design</strong>, An arch is essentially a curved beam with the loads applied downward in its plane tending to decrease the curvature. The bending moments and shear forces are smaller than corresponding internal forces in a simply supported beam covering the same. The arch ribs are made of concrete members 1500 mm deep and 750 mm wide.</p>
