My choice is the shower wall panels as most bathrooms have flat and level walls which makes the installation of shower panels easier than ceramic tiles. Shower walls definitely have an advantage over tiles in that they consist of fewer parts.</p>

<p>How To Compare Acrylic Vs Laminated Shower Wall Panels Tub To Shower Remodel Shower Remodel Acrylic Shower Walls Recesses are in my opinion easier in tiles though others might disagree. Lighter coloured tiles and grouting in particular can quickly fade and turn yellowish in colour. So panels will stay cleaner for longer but what about style. However shower walls wont be to everyones taste.</p>
